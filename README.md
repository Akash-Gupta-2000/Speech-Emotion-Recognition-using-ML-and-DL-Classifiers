# Speech Emotion Recognition using ML and DL Classifiers
This project aims to propose a multi-class classification model to extract and classify the emotional state of the speaker into 8 classes namely happy, sad, surprised, disgust, neutral, calm, angry and fearful. In this project, two Machine Learning (ML) classifiers namely K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Classifier and Random Forest (RF) Classifier along with the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier of Deep Learning (DL) are used for determining the emotional features from the speech signals. 

# About the Dataset
The dataset for this research is obtained from the RAVDESS. Along with the audio speeches of 24 actors, audio songs dataset is also utilised for the better training of the proposed model.
